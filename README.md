# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

## Description
In this project, I'll be analysing Tweets from Twitter website and extract the sentiment out of them.
In order to achieve this goal, I'll be scrapping Twitter website to get differents tweets. Then, I'll be using a pre-trained model that uses NLP (Natural Language Processing) technics for sentiment analysis.
Building a sentiment analysis model from scratch will be done in my next project.
